# dbd-companion-graphql

This is the graphql layer for my DBD Companion app. It is hosted on Heroku Free Dynos where I have a private login to the GraphIQL interface where I wrote the GraphQL queiries to import the data. You can see the imported data original JSON format from Steam in the files section.

The GraphQL layer connectes to a MongoDB Free teir flat database structure.
