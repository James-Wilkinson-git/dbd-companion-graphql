# dbd-companion-graphql

This is the graphql layer for my DBD Companion app. It is hosted on Render.com where I have a private login to the GraphIQL interface where I wrote the GraphQL queries to import the data. You can see the imported data original JSON format from Steam in the files section.

The GraphQL layer connects to a MongoDB Free tier flat database structure.
